# NQAC
A Neural Query Auto Completion system based on a neural language model enriched with time sensitivity and user information

**This repository is under construction**

Currently, the repository provides the core code that was used for the experiments for our paper. Especially:
```
autocomplete/train.py
autocomplete/evaluate.py
```

As-is, the code is not yet working. We are working on adding a single entry point to both train and evaluate, as well as providing resources (or pointers to resources) to reproduce our experiments. Ultimately, the objective is to demonstrate how the NQAC network works, but first the repository needs some clean up.
